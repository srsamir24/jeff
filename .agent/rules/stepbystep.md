description: if the prompt is too vague or too much to do at once.
---

if a prompt asks for a very complex scenario or build, Break it into parts and every part the best you can. do not repeat any code. always look for folder structure and the names of the files. if some files seem to be accosiated with what you are doing you sould read the file. and ask the user for more clarification if needed.
